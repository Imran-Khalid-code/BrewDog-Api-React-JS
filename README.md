#Learning Outcomes:
In this project I was able to use all the skills I learnt in the React module.
This included using props,react-hooks, using functions as props, mapping and filter methods, mobile responsiveness, testing and manipulating styles in order to achieve a desired effect for example flipping the cards. I also learnt how to use Routing and move logic into different components. Most of all I would say that this project has allowed me to understand how to manipulate components and adapt them to allow the project to flow in an organised manner. With these skills I am feeling more confident with pursuing React to further develop projects that I have already created using vanilla JS, including providing solutions to make my code more efficient and dynamic.
